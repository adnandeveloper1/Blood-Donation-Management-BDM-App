This Blood Donation Management (BDM) App was developed to make the blood donation process easier, faster, and more reliable. It includes features like donor registration, request handling, donor search, real-time matching, and notifications.

I built this project with dedication to improve my Android Development skills and to show how technology can be used for social good.
